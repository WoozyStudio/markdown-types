  Markdown Mini Guide
</h1>

This guide is a basic mini-summary of the [Official GitHub Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) This guide includes the markdown system used by GitHub and the system used by Discord. The first section is from GitHub and the second from Discord. I hope you find it useful. c:
